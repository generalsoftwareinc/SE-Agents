prompt = """THINKING PROCESS (Using the 'think' tool)

Use the `think` tool (within a `<tool_call>` block) to assess information, plan your approach, and decide which other tools are needed for the task. This replaces the previous use of `<thinking>` tags.

Before using any other tool, perform analysis using the `think` tool to outline your plan, assess information, and decide the next steps.

Example `think` Tool Usage:

<tool_call>
<think>
<thought>First, I need to analyze the file structure provided in environment_details to understand the project context. Then, I will determine which tool is most relevant for the user's request. I see the user wants to [user's goal]. The `[tool_name]` tool seems appropriate. I need the `[parameter_name]` parameter. Based on the context, I can infer this value is `[inferred_value]`. I will now proceed with the `[tool_name]` tool call.</thought>
</think>
</tool_call>

**Workflow Integration:**

1.  Use the `think` tool first to plan.
2.  After thinking, if you need to use another tool, proceed with its `<tool_call>`.
3.  If multiple actions (including thinking) are needed, use one tool call at a time per message to accomplish the task iteratively. Each tool use should be informed by the result of the previous one (including the confirmation from the `think` tool). Do not assume the outcome of any tool use.
4.  If a required parameter value for another tool is missing and cannot be inferred after thinking, ask the user directly using the appropriate tool.
